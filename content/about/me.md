<p>

There are around 8 billion humans on earth.
I'm one of them.
</p>

I have studied architecture, cognitive science
But I always was fascinated with computing, and finally found my place as a developer.

## Job-wise

I'm a back-end developer.
Go and Rust are the langauges that I use.
Most of the systems I work with are back-end of back-ends.

## Tech-wise

I have been staring at computer screens
(even when they were off)
since I was 5.
I have been spending more time behind desktop computers than I spent sleeping.
I have been a text-book nerd all my life.

Trivia Fact: My favorite genre of books is text-books. 

## Advocacy

I have been involved in free-software advocacy over +15 years.
I am probably falling very harshly on the far-left of political stereotypes. 
I'm a feminist, vegan, animal rights advocate. I have been envolved with envrionmentalism. 
There are other things (like [rationalism](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationalist-movement) and utilitarianism and consciousness idealism) but I won't bore you with that.
