## The Name

"prma" is derived from "perma,"
which refers to concepts such as permaculture,
permacomputing, and permanence.
However, it lacks the letter "e" due to the unavailability of perma.dev.
Nevertheless, it still serves its purpose effectively, which is worth noting.
A permanent thing does not necessarily have to be perfect;
however, its imperfections should be transparent and acknowledged.

## The Scope

This blog extends beyond the realm of perma-computing.
Its title symbolizes my personal perspective and endorsement of the concept.
The fascination lies in tools and practices that lend themselves to the creation of long-lasting software.

## The Need: The Pitfalls of Disposable Culture and the Quest for Quality 

It is crucial to recognize that everything in life is impermanent.
However, if we continue to base our lives,
civilization, and humanity on embracing impermanence,
it will ultimately lead to our downfall.

Unfortunately, this has become the prevailing norm.
The tools and products we utilize have become increasingly disposable and inexpensive.
Yet, the trade-off for this convenience is that
we accumulate a plethora of substandard items that inevitably break within a matter of two years or less.
Consequently, our only concern for the following two-year period becomes,
"What will be my next disposable possession?"

This lack of agency results in
a never-ending cycle of wasting time and resources on constantly replacing broken items.
It's akin to living in a rental property compared to owning a homeâ€”when you know you won't be there for more than a year or two,
you become less invested in improving your living environment.

Consequently, our overall quality of life suffers.
Our surroundings are composed of low-quality disposable items,
and we refrain from investing in superior alternatives due to the constant need
to consider the next disposable set that will arrive in a couple of years,
perpetuating this cycle.

Ultimately, this mindset contributes to environmental disasters,
much like the detrimental impact of using plastic cups instead of reusable ones.

We simply cannot afford to settle for low quality.
